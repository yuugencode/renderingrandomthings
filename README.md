# renderingrandomthings

Heavily work in progress.

Experimenting with C++20 modules and various graphics libraries.
Goal is to try out various non-realistic raytracing rendering ideas.

Currently just a simple 1SPP raytracer with reflections/hard shadows.
It's faster than I expected from a standard CPU raytracer, but maybe I have too many CPU cores.

Exists mostly for portfolio purposes, so no build files or anything included.

Uses bgfx, SDL2, glm, ufbx, mimalloc, stb_image and resize.
